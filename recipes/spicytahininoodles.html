    <h4>Spicy tahini noodles with garlic and lime</h4>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Sriracha Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup tahini or peanut butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>2-3 tablespoons sriacha sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons oyster sauce or soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>juice of 1 lime</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Broccolini</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>6 cups roughly chopped broccolini</li>
        <li>1 shallot, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup shelled edamame</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>juice of half a lime</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Noodles</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>16 ounce noodles</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons nooch</li>
        <li>sliced green onions</li>
        <li>sesame seeds to top</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the sauce  mix together the tahini, water, oyster sauce, hot sauce, lime juice, olive oil and sugar in a small glass until it's all smooth in there. You know, sauce-like. Set it aside. </li>
        <li>In a large skillet or wok, warm up the olive oil to cook the broccolini. Throw the chopped shallot in there and saute it around until it starts to look translucent, about 1-2 minutes. Add the chopped broccolini and cook for another 2-3 minutes. Drizzle in the soy sauce, stir it around and keep cooking until the broccolini are as tender as you like that shit. For us itâ€™s another minute or two. Add the frozen edamame and cook for just long enough for them to warm up, about a minute. Turn off the heat, scrap those fibrous motherfuckers on to a plate, top with the lime juice, and save that dirty pan for the noodles.
        </li>
        <li>Now we put the whole damn thing together. Heat back up that same skillet with a little more olive oil. Add the garlic and saute the shit around just until it starts smelling all garlicky and good, about 30 seconds. Add the noodles to the pan, toss, and then drizzle over the sriracha sauce you made earlier. Stir the noodles around until they all look coated then sprinkle over the nooch and turn off the heat.  If the sauce it getting a little too thick add another tablespoon or 2 of water to loosen the dish up and help the sauce coat the noodles. Top with the green onions and sesame seeds and serve right away or eat at room temp along with the broccolini. This is also super good cold the next day with sliced cucumber and cilantro thrown in. Just sayin
